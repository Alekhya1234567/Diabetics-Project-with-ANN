This project aims to predict the likelihood of diabetes in individuals using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model. 
The dataset, which includes various health-related attributes like age, BMI, blood pressure, and glucose levels, is pre-processed and analyzed to ensure accurate predictions. 
The model is built using a feedforward neural network, optimized through backpropagation, and evaluated on multiple performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. 
The outcome of this project is a predictive system that can assist healthcare professionals in identifying high-risk individuals for early intervention and prevention. 
The project leverages Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Keras for data handling and model training
